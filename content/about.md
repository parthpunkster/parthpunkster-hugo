## *Work*
### *Software Development Engineer* at **Amazon Advertising** (Aug 2019 - Present)
As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Advertising, I served as a Techlead in a team of 3 engineers, leading the redesign of Amazon Ads' Advertiser Catalog service. This involved collaborating with the business to define the BRD and overhauling the campaign creation workflow. We migrated to AWS and created a Tier-1 Restful ECS service and data ingestion pipeline, handling multiple datasets with over 1 billion records. The pipeline, utilizing SQS, SNS, Step Function, Lambda, and Open Search, employed an intelligent chunking algorithm across serverless workers.

Additionally, I played a crucial role in implementing an orchestration system, enabling 1-click campaign creation and optimization, which resulted in significant automation and a revenue increase of $52 million for Amazon. I developed a reusable React component backed by a Lambda service to manage user preferences across applications, benefiting three clients with a P95 of 10ms.

As a senior developer, I spearheaded various org-level initiatives, including designing a peak readiness planning process for load tests on Tier-1/2 systems, generating 75 million in Ads revenue. I also established a streamlined System Integration process and contributed significantly to team expansion through hiring and mentorship.

Furthermore, I optimized an algorithm to enhance campaign creation by 45% through reduced API latency and improved user experience.

### *Software Developer Intern* at **Trinet Inc.** (Jun 2018 - Aug 2018)
Worked on implementing access control system for displaying menus based on criteria like role, position, department and company. Additionally also implemented a new service which displays the status of all the API's which are currently under maintenance and all its related details like effective date, time of completion and level of alertness.
